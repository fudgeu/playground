# playground

_Created for UCF CDL's Hackday Spring 2024_

playground is exactly that - a playground where learners can mess around with and learn new math and computer concepts. The goal is to feature multiple custom made pages, each featuring a separate concept. Each page will have an interactive toolkit that allows users to see the concept in action, and feature content describing the concept, how it works, and it's uses.

The main concept that I wanted to focus on was transformation matrices. This actually stems from a personal experience I had recently, where I was trying to find a site that allowed me to play with transformation matrices to see how different combinations of transformations can influence the final product.

Unfortunately, within the 5-hours that I set aside to work on it, I was not able to finish it ðŸ¥² but I do plan on taking this project and turning it into a personal one once I have a little more time in the near future.
